### What are data skills?

Data in and of itself is not valuable to anyone in an organisation. A data professional will try to make sense of the data within a business context by applying certain logic i.e., generate insights or information from the data.

For example:

- A database admin(DBA) designs a database with business context

- A BI developer will understand the business requirements and generate the reports accordingly

- A data scientist will understand the business requirements and develop the models to predict the user behaviours.

Having the domain knowledge on the data combined with technical knowledge to extract the information are essentially called as data skills.

### Data skills for Data Engineers?

**Domain Knowledge**:
Domain knowledge is something that is aquired gradually over the time working in a broader field. It holds all the details of how business processes, operations, regulatory compliances are set up.

Suppose, you are woking with a company specializes in pharmaceuticals. Knowing how the business functions is invaluable in understanding the data itself. This knowledge is completely different from, say, an ecommerce domain.
