### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative language for storing, manipulating and retreiving data in databases.

We write queries like statement in SQL to perform actions on data or the database itself. For example, below query retreives all the records from a database table

```sql
SELECT * FROM <database_name>.<table_name> 
```

It offers a simple interface to interact with data stored in a database without having to write lengthy programs. This has served wide veriety of data personnel from various backgrounds well over four decades.

### Why Data Engineers Need SQL?

Data engineering tools and processes have evolved quite a lot over the years and one tool kept its relevance through all these times i.e., SQL.

Since SQL offered a simplistic interface to deal with data, many data warehousing tools like [Hive](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-hive/), and query engines like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) adopted SQL as one of their main interfaces.
