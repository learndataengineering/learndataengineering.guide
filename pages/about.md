Hello learner ðŸ‘‹, welcome to learn data engineering guide.

## What is this guide? and who is this for?

It is an opensource guide for anyone who is trying to break into the field of data engineering, beginners or experienced professionals alike. It has the list of list of all the key skills required and important topics for each of them.

### How does this guide work?

It provides the list of all the fundamental skills required along with the necessary depth for each skill.

### Is this guide enough to learn data engineering?

It will emphasize on the core concepts. This will cover a solid ground in data engineering and learners can further dive into other required skills later.

### Why this guide?

It is the consolidation of few years of industry experience of the original creator combined with countless interviews of candidates over the years. The intention is to lower the barrier to entry or upskill in the field with solid foundational skills.
