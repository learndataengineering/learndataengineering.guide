Hello learner ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the data engineering guide!

### Introduction

As data engineers we deal with various data and engineering aspects to serve the data to various stakeholders. There are a ton of tools used in the modern data architectures.

As a beginner or even as an experienced data professional, it is very easy to get lost trying to understand what skills are required for data engineering and how to become a data engineer.

This guide intends to solve that specific problem. It provides a clear path to the core data engineering skillset and beyond. More on the guide [here](https://www.learndataengineering.guide/faqs/).

### Modern Data Engineering Landscape

The opensource revolution of the [Hadoop ecosystem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hadoop-ecosystem/) years enabled every oraganization to build their own data platforms with plethora of tools.

Shortly after their success, the opensource tools fell short of their expectations since they needed lot of software engineering, networking and baby-sitting skills to get the right data output within time.

The [modern data engineering platform](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-building-blocks-of-a-modern-data-platform-92e46061165) greatly abstracts a lot of complexities of the data stack of the previous [Hadoop](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-hadoop) years. The focus is on serving the quality data at scale with confidence and with minimal intrevention as possible.

The opensource tools of big data era are productized in modern data platforms. Abstracting the complexity away from the end users i.e., data teams is the main goal here. For example: [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) offers [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) as a unified compute platform for data engineering and data science workloads.

Since the focus has shifted from data tools to resulting data once again, We see a growing interest in enterprise data mamanagement tools and processes.

### Data Engineering Lifecycle

Lets talk about the data engineering lifecycle. It is the heart of all the activities that a data engineering team performs.

The different stages of data engineering lifecycle are:

1. Generation - data is produced at source systems

2. Ingestion - data is copied from source systems to a storage system at an interval

3. Storage - data storage like data lake or data warehouse

4. Transformation - data is converted to specified format

5. Serving Data - data is made available for various stakeholders for further analysis

The data engineering lifecycle also encompasses the undercurrents like:

- Security - Access control to data and systems

- Data Management - Data Discoverability, Data Definitions, Data Accountability, Data Modeling, Data Integrity

- DataOps - Observability, Monitoring, Incident reporting

- Data Architecture - Analyze trade-offs, Design for agility, Add value to the business

- Orchestration - Coordinate workflows, Schedule jobs, Manage tasks

- Software Engineering - Programming and coding skills, Software design patterns, Testing and Debugging

In the modern data engineering, old is new. The terms like [data governance](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/data-governance) and [data lineage](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/data-lineage#:~:text=Data%20lineage%20is%20the%20process,destination%20within%20the%20data%20pipeline.) are also seeing a ressurgence after the Hadoop era.

Most of the activties that a data engineer performs on a daily basis can be built using few core skills listed in the next section.

### Skillset for Modern Data Engineering

Without complicating, data engineers need strong data skills and good software engineering skills

#### a. Data Skills

- SQL
- Data Warehousing basics
- Data Modelling

#### b. Software Engineering Skills

- One programming language. Preferrably Python.
- Git

#### c. Data Engineering Tools

- Basics of distributed computing
- Hadoop Ecosystem Components
- Data Warehouse like Apache Spark with Cloud Storage or Snowflake, BigQuery

#### d. Additional Skills

- Pipeline Orchestration tools like Airflow, Azure Data Factory and etc
- Cloud services for data engineering

Lets understand the skills one by one here.
