## What is this guide? and who is this for?

It is an opensource guide for anyone who is trying to break into the field of data engineering, beginners or experienced professionals alike. It has the list of list of all the key skills required and covers important topics for each of them.

### How does this guide work?

It provides the list of all the fundamental skills required along with the necessary depth for each skill.

### Is this guide enough to learn data engineering?

It will emphasize on the core concepts. Core concepts cover a solid ground in data engineering and learners can further dive into other required skills later as per their job or any specific task(s).

### Why this guide?

It is the consolidation of few years of industry experience of the original creator combined with countless interviews of candidates over the years. The intention is to lower the barrier to entry or upskill in the field with solid foundational skills.

### Is it a roadmap?

NO! This is a guide like a study plan and unlike any roadmap, this guide will not include every skill in data engineering. It’ll cover the fundamentals well.

### What if there is a new tech or tool in the industry? Will the guide cover that?

Modern data engineering is very broad field. There are a lot of tools and technologies that can solve a single problem. If the said tool solves a set of problems really well compared to existing ones the yes it will be added else its a no.

### Can I contribute to the guide?

YES! This is an opensource guide and the goal is to serve the data engineering community with it.
